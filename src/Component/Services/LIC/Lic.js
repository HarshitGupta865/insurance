                  In our country, which is one of the most populated in the
                  world, the prominence of insurance is not as widely
                  understood, as it ought to be. What follows is an attempt to
                  acquaint readers with some of the concepts of life insurance,
                  with special reference to LIC.{' '}

                  Life insurance is a contract that{' '}

                  (or his nominee) on the happening of the event insured
                  against.
                  <br />
                  The contract is valid for payment of the insured amount

                  Life insurance is universally acknowledged to be an
                  institution, which eliminates 'risk', substituting certainty
                  for uncertainty and comes to the timely aid of the family in
                  the unfortunate event of death of the breadwinner.
                  <br />
                  By and large, life insurance is civilisation's partial
                  solution to the problems caused by death. Life insurance, in
                  short, is concerned with two hazards that stand across the
                  life-path of every person:
                  <ol className="mt-3 fst-italic">
                    <li>
                      That of dying prematurely leaving a dependent family to
